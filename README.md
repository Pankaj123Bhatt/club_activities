<b>3 Slope</b> 

Its a simple calculator which takes two numbers (can be integer pr float) as an input and add or multiply or divide or subtract them.

<b>4 Calendar</b>

This app consists of a calendar which is made by using grid view control. The purpose of the app is to fetch the events on the particular
days according to the calendar uploaded by the admin and to show the events on the app.
There will be two interfaces one for admin where admin will simply upload the calendar containing the info about the events (i.e the name of the event and the date).On the other hand we have user interface where they will be able to see the event datails on the calendar app.
When the admin uploads the file containing calendar detail it goes to the online database. Then from the user perspective if it load calendar, the calendar will be fetched from the database and will be loaded in the calendar app.
